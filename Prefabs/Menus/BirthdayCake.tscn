As Mumei landed heel-first into Kronii's big forehead one last time,
the Warden of Time realized just the sort of predicament she had put herself in.

In a tearful confession, mostly sentimental but indubitably assisted by a quickly rising migraine,
Kronii the Concussed admitted that her powers had been put to the service of an altogether
ludicrous and selfish cause: she simply did not want Mumei's Birthday to end.

But Civilization has a way to resolve every problem ... violence! 
Blasting through every trap and
enchanted creature, Mumei finally arrived at the core of the issue and time can
finally advance in the Bunkeronii!

Happy Birthday Mumei!"

I have been daydreaming on and off about making videogames since the day I first grabbed a Mega Drive controller, many years ago.
 Even though this dream of mine was never truly dead, it never found something that it could latch on and reach its conclusion. 

As things in life goes, I eventually resigned myself to accept that making a game people would play and enjoy was simply a childhood
fancy that would never come to pass, even if this was the whole reason I embarked on the path of IT.

                                                                                                  Until now.

Nanashi Mumei, thank you for breathing life back to this forgotten dream. I would never have happened without your inspirational 
presence which gave the whole team the driving force to push through and do our level best, just as you do every time you appear on 
screen, in good days and bad days. Have a great year to come and get ready to rule the VTuber world!

And thank you for playing. You, yes you. The person in front of the screen. Thank you whomever you are for making it to this point! "
